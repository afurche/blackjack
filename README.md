# blackjack
Very basic implementation of **Blackjack** (without splits, doubles) in pygame using OOP Python. <br/> 
Player chips are introduced in, their balance is saved to save.txt file after quiting the game. <br/> 
Game assets (sprites, music and font) are removed due to uncertain copyrights. <br/>
